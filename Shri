What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system which helps us to manage, colaborate and maintain the source code efficiently.
We can have a copy of repop on local machine and modify it without having worry of central server  connection and once we makde the changes we can push it to the central repo.
Users can also create branches, merge changes and work independantly.
